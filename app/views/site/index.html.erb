        Joel and Suzie took our pup in like she was their own.
        They genuinely love dogs and care about their wellbeing.
        A lot of other groomers run their shop like a "business",
        but Joel and Suzie put their hearts into it and it shows in their work.

        Simply put, there's no one better.
        Joel & Susie have always been so good to us and our dog, that we drive from Hayward for grooming sessions.
        They bend over backwards to accommodate us and we couldn't be more thankful for them taking such great care of Dexter.

        A quick update to thank Joel & Susie at Super Pups from the bottom of our hearts for finding our Francis' cancer 3+ years ago.
        He's now outlived the expected lifespan following diagnosis and just today got another good report.
        It might have been very different if Joel and Susie weren't so good at what they do and brought it to my attention!
        Thank you, thank you, thank you!! I'm forever in your debt!
