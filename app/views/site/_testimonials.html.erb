        grooming sessions. They bend over backwards to accommodate us and we couldn't be more thankful for them taking such great care of
        Dexter."

      He's now outlived the expected lifespan following diagnosis and just today got another good report.
      It might have been very different if Joel and Susie weren't so good at what they do and brought it to my attention!
      Thank you, thank you, thank you!! I'm forever in your debt!"
